This is my first experiment with creating a web page. Baby-steps :) 
It took 3 days and 4 times burning the created page, to start from scratch but
despite the pain caused by aligning divs and understanding how positioning
works, the whole process is very satisfying. I really feel how the ability
to understand grows day by day. Cant wait when javascript lessons will begin.
